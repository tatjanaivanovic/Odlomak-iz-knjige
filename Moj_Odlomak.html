		<h1>The 10,000 - Hour Rule</h1>
		<h3><em>"In Hamburg, we had to play for eight hours."</em></h3>
		<p><b>The University of Michigan</b> opened its new Computer
	Center in 1971, in a brand-new building on Beal Avenue
	in Ann Arbor, with beige-brick exterior walls and a
	dark-glass front. The university's enormous mainframe
	computers stood in the middle of a vast white room,
	looking, as one faculty member remembers, "like one of
	the last scenes in the movie <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0062622/">
	2001: A Space Odyssey"</a>. Off
	to the side were dozens of keypunch machines—what
	passed in those days for computer terminals. In 1971,
	his was state of the art. <b>The University of Michigan</b> had
	one of the most advanced computer science programs in
	the world, and over the course of the Computer Center's
	life, thousands of students passed through that white
	room, the most famous of whom was a gawky teenager
	named <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Joy">Bill Joy</a>.
	</p>
	<p>
	Joy came to the <b>University of Michigan</b> the year the
	Computer Center opened. He was sixteen. He was tall
	and very thin, with a mop of unruly hair. Fie had been
	voted "Most Studious Student" by his graduating class at
	North Farmington High School, outside Detroit, which,
	as he puts it, meant that he was a "no-date nerd." He had
	thought he might end up as biologist or a mathematician. 
	But late in his freshman year, he stumbled across the
	Computer Center—and he was hooked.
	</p>
	<p>
	From that point on, the Computer Center was his life.
	He programmed whenever he could. Joy got a job with 
	a computer science professor so he could program over
	the summer. In 1975, he in graduate school at
	the <b>University of California at Berkeley</b>. There, he buried 
	himself even deeper in the world of computer software.
	During the oral exams for his PhD, he made up a particularly
	complicated algorithm on the fly that, as one of his 
	many admirers has written, <i>"so stunned his examiners	
	[that] one of them later compared the experience to 'Jesus 
	confounding his elders/ "</i></p></div>
	<div class="floating-box">
	<p>
	Working in collaboration with a small group of programmers,
	Joy took on the task of rewriting UNIX, which
	was a software system developed by AT&T for mainframe
	computers. Joy's version was very good. It was so good, in 
	fact, that it became—and remains—the operating system
	on which literally millions of computers around the world 
	run. <i>"If you put your Mac in that funny mode where you
	can see the code," Joy says, "I see things that I remember 
	typing in twenty-five years ago."</i> And do you know who
	wrote much of the software that allows you to access the
	Internet? Bill Joy.</p>
	<p>
	After graduating from Berkeley, Joy cofounded the
	Silicon Valley firm Sun Microsystems, which was one of
	the most critical players in the computer revolution. There
	he rewrote another computer language—Java—and his
	legend grew still further. Among Silicon Valley insiders,
	Joy is spoken of with as much awe as someone like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Gates">Bill 
	Gates</a>of <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/sr-latn-rs/">Microsoft</a>. He is sometimes called the Edison of
	the Internet. As the Yale computer scientist David Gelernter 
	says,<i>"Bill Joy is one of the most influential people	
	in the modern history of computing/' </i></p>
	<p>
	The story of Bill Joy's genius has been told many times,
	and the lesson is always the same. Here was a world that
	was the purest of meritocracies. Computer programming
	didn't operate as an old-boy network, where you got ahead
	because of money or connections. It was a wide-open field
	in which all participants were judged solely on their talent 
	and their accomplishments. It was a world where the best
	men won, and Joy was clearly one of those best men.</p>
	<p>
	It would be easier to accept that version of events, however, 
	if we hadn't just looked at hockey and soccer players.
	Theirs was supposed to be a pure meritocracy as well. Only
	it wasn't. It was a story of how the outliers in a particular
	field reached their lofty status through a combination of
	ability, opportunity, and utterly arbitrary advantage.
	Is it possible the same pattern of special opportunities
	operate in the real world as well? Let's go back over the
	story of Bill Joy and find out... </p>
